# Abstract
A general overview of the role that analytical methods can play in evaluating several aspects of human resource management, including staff recruitment and retention, compensation and benefits, and skill inventories. The creation of a specialised analytics Dashboard for this organisation that focuses on strategy and human resources management is the purpose of this report. The directors and senior officials of the organization's management team should be able to rely on it for assistance when putting their strategic decisions into action.

# Introduction
Decision-making in businesses is complicated and depends on credible data in a competitive and connected environment. Firms and HR managers are under pressure to respond quickly to the changing business environment. Businesses try to reconstruct their structures and reinvent their practises and processes. Analytics can help in some cases. According to the literature, most organisations that have embraced Analytics can make better decisions faster. Businesses restructure, redefine, and streamline their operations. In some cases, analytics inform decisions. According to the literature, firms that embrace Analytics can make faster, more accurate decisions. According to research (Wawer and Muryjas, 2016), the human mind's ability to make optimal business decisions is insufficient in an era of rising data and sophisticated analytical needs. Analytics becomes a significant tool that blends business and IT, delivering crucial data to decision-makers via simulations and scenarios to optimise organisational development and forecast business results and customer behaviour. Empower HR leaders to build effective plans by offering them access to a wide range of workforce-related data to aid in planning, simulate planning circumstances, and evaluate real performance compared to plan to make better strategic judgements. Organizations can change their aims and objectives, change their programmes, and reallocate their resources and cash. In essence, performance metrics serve as a feedback loop in the process of managing corporate performance.
# Company Overview:

With operations in 171 countries, IBM is a global technology business with its headquarters in Armonk, New York. IBM develops and sells computer hardware, software, middleware, hosting, and consulting services for a wide range of applications, including nanotechnology and computer systems. Additionally, IBM is a well-known research institution. It held the record for the most yearly U.S. patents produced by a firm for 28 years in a row (as of 2020). Around 282,100 people were employed by IBM as of December 2021, making it one of the top 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average firms and one of the biggest employers worldwide.
The organisation, which is centred on highly skilled and qualified technical professionals, is fully dependent on the skill of its workforce to drive performance and carry on its tradition of sound financial success.

According to figure 1 above, IBM's revenue in 2021 is anticipated to surpass 57 billion US dollars. Since 2011, when IBM's revenues reached a record 106.9 billion US dollars, revenues have decreased. IBM is still one of the most valuable technology brands in the world, just behind Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, despite its recent decline. In essence, the business is engaged in creating value by reducing clients' operational costs and utilising competencies critical to revenue generation (IBM, 2013).

IBM's net profit increased from $5.59 billion in 2020 to $5.74 billion in 2021. Up until 2013, net income had been increasing continuously. The business hasn't performed consistently well since then. A portion of this can be attributable to the rapidly evolving market environment. Following an industry-wide digital revolution, IBM is altering its business strategy to focus more on providing smart solutions and cloud platforms than just hardware, software, and services. In 2016 IBM reorganised its software portfolio and modified its segment reporting to reflect this shift in strategy.
 
The most valued supplier of IT services globally in 2020, according to Figure 3, is Accenture, which has a brand value of roughly 26 billion dollars, followed by IBM and TCS.

Source: IBM Annual Report 2021, page 17 Figure 4: IBM number of employees worldwide

According to number 4, the American technology company IBM employed more than 282,000 people globally in 2021. IBM has been facing declining revenues and is working to change its business strategy therefore, which might account for the decline in the number of current employees.
The challenges that IBM is up against are not dissimilar to those that are encountered by a great number of other businesses operating in the unpredictable and uncertain economic and social atmosphere in which modern multinational enterprises are required to do business. There is a strong desire among the leadership teams of a company that has such a heavy reliance on human, knowledge, and intellectual capital to learn more about the workforce and how they can be mobilised through HR activities to boost the organization's productivity and performance. This desire comes from the fact that the workforce is the most important asset the company has.

The company has a strong HR department and a good handle on its finances. Also, the company gets its business solutions from the top corporate portfolios of consulting, service delivery and implementation, enterprise software, and systems.
Due to the unpredictability of the industry, the business knows it needs to set up effective, effective, and competent human resources in order to provide clients with quality goods and services. In a competitive world where things change quickly, efficient and effective human capital is one of the main keys to success
In reality, the company's human resources are in line with its business plan (Mellow, 2011). Also, the firm's human resource strategies focus on making connections between the organization's broad tactical goals and the whole process of putting them into action.
The firm's published studies show a statistically significant link between more companies using good HR practises and more success for those companies. Because the company has found a basic link between human resource management and better business performance, its leaders have been able to create programmes that lead to better operational results, which in turn makes it more likely that the company will achieve high performance (Armstrong & Baron, 2003). Globalization, changing demand, and more competition all have an effect on a company's strategy. This is especially true for companies like IBM that work in a very volatile industry.
 
IBM needs to keep improving its performance in order to stay ahead of the competition. It can do this by cutting costs, coming up with new products, making business processes more efficient, improving product quality, and putting new products on the market at the right time (McAfee et al., 2011). So, the firm's strategy must be designed to help it reach its goals.
Human resources' primary job is to build competent personnel in all business sectors in order to improve organisational performance. HR policies at the organisation, like selection, training, and enhancing the work environment, as well as performance review, are aimed at increasing the needed skills for enhanced performance. To learn more about the workforce and how they may be mobilised through HR activities to boost the firms productivity and performance is to create a HR dashboard. This is an important tool enabling the executives to align the overall corporate strategy of the organisation and its HR activities at the functional level and assist in data driven decision making.

# What is HR dashboard?

A business analytics tool called an HR dashboard allows teams in the HR Department to monitor, evaluate, and report on HR key performance indicators (KPIs). Utilizing an HR analytics platform, modern interactive dashboards make it simple to combine data from many systems and conduct in-depth analysis of that data from within the dashboard. This makes it possible for HR departments to quickly find insights that might enhance hiring, optimise workplace management, and raise employee productivity.
In order to make the shift from analogue to digital, HR companies need to adopt fresh technology that will let them reinvent themselves and keep up with rapid changes in the fiercely competitive market for luring, keeping, and growing talent (Goldstein, 2015). The execution of business operations via the use of electronic forms has become essential to a company's success. Like all other company tasks, the Human Resources (HR) job is becoming increasingly computerised. This improvement made it possible for HR managers to utilise the data in every manner imaginable to create better HR metrics for the company. As organisations want to evaluate the performance of all functional areas in realistic terms, the creation of new HR metrics has become crucial; supported measures are the only way to demonstrate this.
An organization's most important resource is its workforce. HR dashboards that are interactive and persona-based leverage an HR analytics platform that lets users see data directly from the dashboard.

# HR Dashboard KPIs

Reviewing and analysing the IBM workforce may be done in a more expedient and well-organized manner if the appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) are used. The following is a list of the metrics that we need to take into consideration for the four primary categories that are workforce management, attrition, remuneration, and recruiting respectively.
Workforce Management KPIs:
• Employee satisfaction rate
• Training ROI
• HR effectiveness
• Worker composition by gender, experience, and tenure
• Time to productivity
• Promotion rate
• Absenteeism rate Compensation KPIs:
• Labour cost revenue percent
• Revenue per FTE
• Profit vs. compensation per FTE
• Human capital ROI
• HR functional cost per employee
Recruitment KPIs:
• Quality of hire
• V acancy rate
• Turnover rate
• Resignation/retirement rate
• Diversity
• Experience
• Gender hire ratio
• Retention rate
• Retirement rate forecast
Therefore, we created an HR analytical dashboard that can aid in increasing data literacy within the company, encourage a culture of innovation and discovery, and empower employees at all levels to gain a competitive edge. If we have trustworthy and well-organized data, we can make better and quicker judgments, which is possible. We have therefore obtained data from Kaggle. The IBM data scientists produced the dataset. Nearly 1500 current and former employees are included in the data, along with details about their tenure, experience, salary, and demographics, as well as information about their job satisfaction and work-life balance. Here is a quick summary of the data along with some summary statistics.


<img width="774" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-17 at 15 04 18" src="https://github.com/NaveenSooriya/HR-Analytical-Dashboard/assets/98401606/30dae08d-d0e7-404b-bcfd-efa23ffca96a">


 Table 1: Overview of the IBM dataset
Strategies for employee retention are essential to a business's success and profitability. In this dashboard, we'll look at some of the most significant reasons why employees quit organisations. Since it keeps track of how many people leave a company, employee attrition is a prominent statistic used by organisations to assess their success. Despite the fact that turnover rates differ by sector, the Bureau of Labour Statistics projected a 25 percent overall turnover rate among voluntary separations in 2020
Exploratory data analysis:

 Figure 5 shows that almost one out of every three women who worked in Women's Human Resources left the organisation. The most men left the Sales department than any other.


 
 From the above figure 6, Managers and Research Directors earn the most on average, while Laboratory Technicians and Sales Representatives earn the least.

 Using figure 7, The scatterplot above shows that an employee's pay are closely related to their job level and that monthly income is positively correlated with the total number of years worked.
 
 Figure 8 shows: According to this graph, the most important things that affect how often an employee leaves are their monthly salary, their age, and whether they work overtime. Also, information about their job history, like the total number of years they've worked and how long they've been with the company and with their manager, as well as how close they live to the office and how much their pay has gone up, are some of the most important factors in figuring out who will leave.
Now let’s explore our user-friendly dashboard that contains various layers/levels that enables users the choice to drill down further into data points of interest.

We developed a user manual which supports users to understand how to use and interpret the dashboard.
Dashboard:

We imported the excel file into Tableau. Tableau is a visual analytics tool that helps people and organisations use data to solve issues. Once Tableau is launched, ready data connectors link to the database (excel file). Tableau has built-in visualisation features. Each visualisation is intuitive and self-depicting since most features are drag-and-drop. So, which department has the most attrition? Who has the highest attrition rate? We considered employee attributes that varied by gender as key KPI metrics, such as hourly rate, percent salary hike, total working years, work-life balance, job satisfaction, number of companies worked, performance Rating, average number of years with the manager, and average employee performance rate. It includes attrition due to business travel
 
# User Manual
The primary source of data is the employee attrition rate. The percentage of overall staff attrition is shown next to it. The average years tenure box represents the average length of time employees stay with an organisation. Following that, we can observe the count of attrition rate by gender, which is 87 females and 150 males. We can pick different departments from the Department drop down menu, and we can scroll down and filter different job roles from the Job Role drop down option. Users can interact with the dashboard by filtering the drop-down menus for department and job role. This is the initial layer of the dashboard, and it provides important information such as the employee attrition rate, the attrition rate depending on gender, the average number of years the employee worked in the organisation, and the best part is that the drop-down menu allows users to filter the data. According to the dashboard, 237 percent of the firm's employees are leaving the company, with 150 male employees and 87 female employees. The average number of years an employee works for IBM is seven years.

Figure 2: Attrition rate by Department
The above bar chart illustrates the attrition rate by department. Human Resources has the lowest attrition rate, with 5.06 percent of employees departing the organisation. Approximately 38.82 percent of employees in the sales department are leaving the company. Let us pause here since the Research & Development department is losing the most workers, roughly 56.12 percent, with 133 employees leaving the firm.
 Figure 3: Attrition rate by Job Role
The bar graph clearly shows that employees with the job title "Laboratory Technician" have the greatest attrition rate, with approximately 26.16 percent of employees leaving the organisation. Laboratory Technician Sales Executive had a 24.05 percent attrition rate, and Research Scientist had a 19.83 percent attrition rate.

 Figure 4: Attrition rate by Business Travel
The figure depicts the Attrition Rate Due to Business Travel. Employees who do not travel for business had the lowest attrition rate of 5.06 percent. Employees who "Travel Frequently" have a 29.11 percent attrition rate, which is still lower than the 65.82 percent attrition rate of employees who "Travel Rarely."
Figure 5: Employee Attributes
 
From the image, we can see many KPIs for this dashboard. First bar shows average employee work engagement (2.73%). Average Job Satisfaction is 2.729%. 2.693% of employees worked for multiple companies. 3.154 percent of people are good performers with 4.123 years of average manager relationship. Employees average 65.89% pound per hour and 15.21% wage boost. The average workday is 11 hours. Work-life balance averages 2.76 percent.
Figure 6: Attrition rate by employees Travel rarely
According to the graph, the attrition rate of employees in the job role Laboratory Technician is very low, with the average employee returning to the organisation after 62 days. Next to them, Research Analysts leave the organisation after only 47 days.
According to what we found, 16% of employees left the company in the last quarter, with more than half of them leaving the R&D department. The most women leave the HR department than any other. About one in four employees who had the worst balance between work and life left the company, even though the majority of those who left rated their job satisfaction as great or excellent.
# HR Dashboard Benefits:
• HR Monitoring
• Employee Retention
• Automated Reporting
• Management Information
• Increased Transparency
• Comprehensive View
• Data Delivery
• Enhanced Communication
• Trend Analysis
In today's dynamic and demanding corporate environment, the manager's role has never been more important. Managers must collaborate and coordinate in order to respond as an unified organisation. The ability of human resources to
 
analyse the data at their disposal is important to success. Managers, on the other hand, cannot be expected to work alone on this. Setting aside time for tracking, analysing, and reporting is crucial to ensuring that managers make good use of data, metrics, and KPIs.
Conclusion:
Employee passion, dedication, and role involvement should be increased. Human resource management should encourage employees to identify with the company's core values and freely act on those principles in order to help the organisation achieve its goals. Human resource management should also build a culture of trust and accountability, as well as define psychological trust. Because human resources personnel is the primary asset of a firm that produces competence and a competitive edge for the company to flourish in its operations, developing an HR dashboard would lessen the issue of subordinating the employees when making changes in an organization's strategy. So, in order to understand the company, we conducted extensive study on the industry, business environment, and competitors. Data is gathered through Annual Reports, business news, and other pertinent papers, among other sources
